Disable system hibernation
If you donâ€™t use Hibernation but it is activated, you can recover some few gigabytes. The file C:\hyberfil.sys is usually pretty huge (about 75% of the total amount of RAM) so no need to keep that kind of file, especially if you got a lot of RAM. To delete this file, simply disable hibernation in the Advanced Power Settings in the Control Panel or by typing this command :

1
powercfg -h off
